### Introduction

Everyone talks about big data, and odds are you might be working for a company that does in fact have big data to process. Big data meaning that you can't actually control it all, you can't actually wrangle it all on just one system. You need to actually compute it using the resources of an entire cloud, a cluster of computing resources. And that's where Apache Spark comes in. Apache Spark is a very powerful tool for managing big data, and doing machine learning on large Datasets. By the end of the chapter, you will have an in-depth knowledge of the following topics:

- Working with Spark
- Decision Trees in Spark
- K-Means Clustering in Spark

### Clone Repository

Let's first setup VScode editor and clone repository. Clone the following repository by executing following command in the terminal.
`git clone https://github.com/athertahir/datascience-machine-learning.git`{{execute}}

Now, move in the directory which contains the source code.

`cd datascience-machine-learning`{{execute}}


**Note:**
- The supplied commands in the next steps MUST be run from your `datascience-machine-learning` directory. 
- Final code was already cloned from github for this scenario. You can just understand the application code in the next steps and run it using the instructions.
- Click **IDE Editor** tab to open Visual Studio and open solution explorer and open `datascience-machine-learning` to view files.
